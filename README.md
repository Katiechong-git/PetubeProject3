If you want to get interactive, you can click the title of the video you’re interested, which will bring you to the video’s own page.

### Project Objective

Design Website based on accessibilities and other design considerations. Learn and explore the popular and powerful MERN stack techologies(MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js)to building dynamic web sites and web applications. Because all components of the MERN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, we can learn more about Javascript via building the MERN applicationsusing one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.
